        <h1>Welcome to our site!</h1>
        <p>Chez Fur welcomes you to come for coffee and snacks. Stay to be entertained by our furry
            hosts as they play in our outdoor Katio or indoor Kitty Kondo. While some of our hosts may
            be a bit shy, others are happy to greet you with a request for a head scratch or gentle pet.
            Just let them lead the way! Sit back and enjoy the company of the cats. You may find that
            one of our cuddly kitties would like to adopt you.</p>
